# Dining Insights: Singapore

## Overview

Welcome to the Dining Insights project by Group 3! This Python project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from dine-in food places, including restaurants and coffee shops, in Singapore. Our objective aligns with the requirements of the ICT1002 Programming Fundamentals course, aiming to apply and deepen our Python programming skills, practice team collaboration using Python tools and libraries, and gain hands-on experience in solving real-world problems.

## Project Scope

In adherence to the project specifications, we will explore various aspects of dining establishments in Singapore, such as:

- **Location Ratings:** Identifying areas with higher ratings based on customer reviews.
- **Price Analysis:** Analyzing the distribution of food prices, highlighting places with more expensive and more affordable options.
- **Cuisine Diversity:** Exploring the types of cuisine available in specific areas.
- **Review Quality:** Identifying locations with better and higher reviews.

## Tools and Technologies

To achieve our objectives, we will leverage the following technologies:

- **Python:** The primary programming language for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Google Maps API:** To scrape relevant data about dine-in establishments in Singapore.
- **Data Visualization Libraries:** Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating pie charts, bar graphs, and other visualizations.

## Project Structure

The project will be organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection:** Scraping relevant data from Google Maps using the Google Maps API.
2. **Data Processing:** Cleaning and organizing the collected data for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis:** Extracting insights from the dataset to answer specific questions about dining establishments.
4. **Data Visualization:** Creating visually appealing and informative charts and graphs to represent our findings.
5. **Documentation:** Providing comprehensive documentation to guide users and developers through the project.
